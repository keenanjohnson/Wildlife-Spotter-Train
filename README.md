## The story

I gound myself in possesion of one of the Lego artic train sets, which is among one of the most fun recent kits.

on the back of the artic train is a camera tripod for spotting wildlife, specifically the artic foxes that are included in the kit. 

I have recently been doing much ecology and as an embedded systems engineer, I thought it would be fun to imrpvoe the set by adding a real camera to the kit.

Additionaly, i had seen the excelent pybricks project ans realized thay I could also via Bluetooth control make a device and software gui that would not only stream video but also control the driving od the train.
